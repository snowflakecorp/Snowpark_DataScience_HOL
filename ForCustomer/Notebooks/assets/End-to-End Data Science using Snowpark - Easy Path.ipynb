    "Time series forecasting produces univariate predictions of future data based on historical input data. A common use case is to forecast sales based on seasonality and other factors.The historical data must include:\n",

    "- A timestamp column.\n",
    "- A target value column representing some quantity of interest at each timestamp.\n",

Like an [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) model, it uses a differencing transformation to model data with a non-stationary trend and uses auto-regressive lags of the historical target data as model features.\n",

    "Additionally, the algorithm uses rolling averages of historical target data to help predict trends and automatically produces cyclic calendar features (such as day of week and week of year) from timestamp data.\n",

    "You can fit models with only historical target and timestamp data, or you may include exogenous data (features) that might have influenced the target value. Exogenous variables can be numerical or categorical and may be NULL (rows containing NULLs for exogenous variables are not dropped).\n",
